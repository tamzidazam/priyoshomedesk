<h2>Who is SmartAtHome.co.uk?</h2>
SmartAtHome.co.uk is just a hobby site ran by me, Mark. I'm nice, I promise. You can email me at mark<code>@</code>smartathome.co.uk.
<h2>Is it safe to give you my Smart Life username and password?</h2>
Your details are passed straight to Smart Life, in order to get an authorisation token. Without that token, this website can't control your devices. Neither the username, password nor the token are stored or logged on my server.
<h2>Is your website secure?</h2>
Yes, the whole site is served over https, you should see a little padlock symbol in your address bar.
<h2>Why do I have to re-login every day?</h2>
I store a small file, called a cookie, on your computer, with your authorisation token. It expires after a few hours though, so you have to log in again.
<h2>How do I know you don't do anything else with my details?</h2>
The code for this website is open sourced on <a href='https://github.com/ndg63276/smartathome'>GitHub</a>, so anyone can check what I'm doing any time.
<h2>I don't have any Smart Life products.</h2>
I do recommend them, they are well made but pretty inexpensive. They can be controlled via the app, or via IFTTT hooks if you want to try something more advanced. There's also a large community of users out there to help you do more with them.
